# Resort-Property-Management
The main objective of this project is to build a resort management  system that consists of all the features and functions required for effectively managing a chain of  resorts and to have an online presence that makes the reservation process easier and delivers  outstanding customer service. The Resort Property Management System will permit employees to  manage the daily administrative tasks of the resort and ensure smooth functioning of the resort.  The system will be able to handle many services to take care of all customers in a quick manner.  As a solution to the large amount of file handling happening at the resort, this software will be  used to overcome those drawbacks.
